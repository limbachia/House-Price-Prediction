# House Price Prediction

This project uses Ames, Iowa housing dataset compiled by Dean De Cook. Dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).  

This project includes step-by-step analysis of Ames, Iowa housing dataset, from data wrangling to building a machine learning model that predicts house prices as accurately as possible.  

Lasso regression model performed the best. The model was finally tested on the test dataset (provided by kaggle). The test __Root-Mean-Squared-Error__ was __0.11840__ which placed the submission in the top 5% of [kaggle's leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/leaderboard#score).
